# toponium_restframe_ATLAS



setupATLAS
lsetup "root recommended"

Need to have installation of RestFrames


and then run 

```root toponium.C``` with modified file names and path

To work with ATLAS sample, we need to ensure TChain is used - this needs to be developed
But for a start we can use one of MC20a files for toponium and ttbar

The toponium.C file needs to be updated
